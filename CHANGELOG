 - Merged polynomial ring and polynomial semiring structures into a single polynomial structure.

## [0.0.14] - 2026-01-01

 - Added Minkowski sum of shapes.
 - Added multithreading to speed up shape algorithms.
 - `RingSignature` no longer requires `EqSignature`.
 - Added traits for representing points as a limit of decreasing subsets.
 - Implemented above traits for intervals on the real line and boxes in the complex plane.
 - Added types for continued fractions and for computing best rational approximations.
 - Added quadratic algebraic number fields.
 - Added `SymmetricMatrix`.
 - Added orders for algebraic number fields and their ideals, with the ring of integers as a special case.
 - Added quotient submodules and quotient ideals.
 - Added conductor of an order in an algebraic number field.

## [0.0.13] - 2025-07-21

 - Added database of Conway polynomials.
 - Added structure for finite fields using Conway polynomials and inclusion maps between finite fields.
 - Fixed a bug in ring of integers multiplication in dimensions >= 3.
 - Rename structure traits from SomethingStructure to SomethingSignature.
 - Moved a bunch of stuff around in algebraeon-rings.
 - Added Legendre Jacobi and Kronecker symbols.
 - Listing ring of algebraic integers ideals of a given norm.
 - Added trait for getting the characteristic of a ring.
 - Allow certain structures to borrow other structures.
 - Basics of quaternion algebras.
 - Started graphs crate.
 - Added trait for ANFs and implemented it for rationals and ANFs via polynomial quotients.

## [0.0.12] - 2025-04-12

 - Ring of Integers
 - Ideal sum, product, intersection, containment, equality for integers and rings of integers.
 - Split Structure into SetStructure for sets and Structure.
 - Structures for morphisms, functions, injective functions, ring homomorphisms, principal subring, field of fractions inclusion...
 - Added try_to_int to CharZeroStructure.
 - Replaced the old CanonicalStructure with a derive proc macro to generate a canonical structure per type. This lets the canonical structure type be defined in the same crate as the type it is the canonical structure of and so lets foreign traits be defined for it.
 - Traits for integral closures, dedekind domains, ideal factorization.
 - Ideal factorization in rings of algebraic integers.
 - Removed reference counters in favour of clones for structures - in most situations the structures are empty anyway.
 - Merged EqStructure and PartialEqStructure.
 - Added is_element() to SetStructure.
 - Structure for a commuting square of integral domain, its field of fractions, a finite field extension, and integral closure. Additional structure when both rings are Dedekind domains for factoring prime ideals of the small ring in the big ring.

## [0.0.11] - 2025-04-05

 - Lots of reorganizing where things are.
 - Added docs and examples to sets::combinatorics.
 - Mucking around trying to get `cargo ws` to work.
 - Added Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization for integers.
 - Added signature of a number field.
 - Removed old prime generator in favour of faster implementation in malachite.
 - Added gcd and factoring for multivariable polynomials over the integers.
 - Updated to rust 2024
 - Created algebraeon-nzq with new Natural, Integer and Rational types wrapping the malachite equivalents.
 - Nicer formatting of multivariable polynomial strings by omitting coefficients and powers equal to 1

## [0.0.10] - 2025-01-19

- P-adic root isolation.
- P-adic root arithmetic up to implementing field structure.

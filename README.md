# Rust-Computational-Algebra
Rust implementation of some computational algebra algorithms. 

This project began as a faster and more maintainable replacement for an older attempt of mine written in Python: https://github.com/pishleback/Python-Computational-Algebra

## Sets

## Groups

## Rings

## Combinatorics

## Geometry

# Old readme:
I need to move this into the sections above...

## Features:
 - Permutations
 - Partitions
 - Finding isomorphisms between finite groups
 - Matricies
 - Euclids algorithm for gcd and extended version for obtaining Bezout coefficients
 - Hermite normal form over a PID
 - Smith normal form over a PID
 - Solution to a linear system of equations over a PID
 - Solution to an affine system of equations over a PID
 - Kronecker's method for factoring polynomials over the integers (very slow)
 - Berlekamp's algorithm for factoring polynomials over finite fields
 - Real root isolation
 - Real root arithmetic
 - Complex root isolation
 - Zassenhaus algorithm for factoring polynomials over the integers
 - Complex root arithmetic
 - Gram–Schmidt algorithm
 - Jordan normal form of a matrix
 - Write symmetric polynomials in terms of elementary symmetric polynomial
 - Factor polynomials over algebraic number fields

## Planned Features
 - LLL basis reduction algorithm
 - Universal cyclotomic field
 - Ideals in algebraic number fields
 - Algebraic closure and Galois theory of finite fields
 - Splitting fields of algebraic number fields
 - Galois groups of algebraic number fields
 - Boolean operations with geometric sximplicial complexes

# Google Summer of Code 2026

Do you have a strong background in pure maths and enjoy programming? You could get paid to contribute to Algebraeon with Google Summer of Code 2026.

> [!NOTE]
> We are hoping to be a mentoring organization in GSoC 2026, though there is no guarantee at this time that we will be accepted into the programme.

## How To Apply

1) Make sure you are familiar with Google Summer of Code and how it works. A good place to start is [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works).
2) Choose a project which interests you from the [project list](project_ideas.md). Alternatively, get in touch with your project idea and we'll see if it's a good fit.
3) Get involved with the community. Try using Algebraeon, ask questions, submit a pull request with a small improvement (fix a typo, add a new test, improve the documentation), etc.
4) Prepare your application. You are strongly encouraged to get feedback before submitting your final application via GSoC [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

A good place to get in contact is via the community Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/DBqbPqPMKR) or the discussions page on GitHub [here](https://github.com/pishleback/Algebraeon/discussions).

## The Application

The main things we want to get out of your application are:
1) A description of the project you wish to undertake. It should include a breakdown of the project into milestones with a rough expected timeline.
2) That you have sufficient expertise in the mathematical areas relevent to the project. You aren't expected to be an expert, but you should have sufficient background knowledge to understand any relevent algorithms.
3) Why you are interested in Algebraeon. Have you used similar tools before. What did you do with them?

You should also include the following information:

1) Your name.
2) A link to your GitHub profile.
3) The best way(s) to contact you.
4) Your time zone.
5) Any commitments you have over summer, so we can plan around them.

You can also let us know who you would prefer to be accepted by if you are also applying to other organizations as part of GSoC.

## Next Steps

If your application is successful, you will spend some time getting familiar with Algebraeon and planning your project with us. You will then spend summer implementing your project. 

We will have regular (~weekly) meetings to check progress, do code reviews, answer questions, etc.
